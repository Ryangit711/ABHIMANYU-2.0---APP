# Anchored Summary — 2026-07-15

## Objective
Add Seaspan as a supported company in `gen_docx.py` so `GEN DOCX Seaspan` produces a proper resume + cover letter with Change Management framing, not the generic else-branch fallback.

## Important Details
- Seaspan role: Change Management Specialist (I Pipe — Internal Strategy/Corporate)
- Must NOT use the generic else branch — that creates unreviewed thin output
- Content must weave Change Management keywords: ADKAR, Kotter, PROSCI-aligned, adoption frameworks, stakeholder engagement, culture integration, change governance
- The Brex resume was previously condensed to 1-page fit (tighter bullets, merged summary stats, condensed education/technical sections) — Seaspan should follow same concise format

## Work State
### Completed
- Added `"Seaspan"` to `_COMPANIES_WITH_CONTENT` set (line 32)
- Added `"Seaspan": "2026-07-14"` to `get_date()` DATES table (line 336)
- Added Seaspan Professional Summary — Change Management practitioner + ops builder narrative, PROSCI-aligned, ADKAR-practiced
- Added Seaspan Core Competencies (8 items: Change Management & Adoption · Organizational Transformation · Stakeholder Engagement · M&A Integration & Culture · Strategic Planning & OKRs · Cross-Functional Leadership · Process Improvement · Operational Infrastructure Design)
- Added 6 experience bullets with bold prefixes: Change Management & Org Transformation, Change Governance & Readiness Frameworks, Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment, P&L Management & Financial Reporting, Training & Capability Building, Executive Reporting & Board Communication
- Added Seaspan Technical Proficiency (ADKAR, Kotter, PROSCI-aligned · Project Management · Jira/Confluence · OKR Frameworks · KPI Dashboards · Google Workspace · EHR/Operational Platforms · Data Visualization)
- Added `"Seaspan": "Change_Management_Specialist"` to role_str mapping (line 994)
- Added `"Seaspan": "July 14, 2026"` to cover letter DATE_LABELS (line 1023)

### Active
- (none — branch is complete, tested, and validated)

### Blocked
- (none)

## Next Move
1. ✅ TEST PASSED: `python3 scripts/gen_docx.py Seaspan` generated valid resume (23 meaningful lines)
2. Files generated:
   - Resume: `Aman_Kumar_Seaspan_Change_Management_Specialist.docx` (OneDrive + Linux)
   - Cover Letter: `Cover_Letter_Seaspan_Change_Management_Specialist.docx` (OneDrive + Linux)
3. When Kash provides the hiring manager name (awaiting since Jul 14), proceed with networking cadence

## Relevant Files
- `scripts/gen_docx.py`: Seaspan branch added at lines ~399 (summary), ~500 (competencies), ~842 (experience bullets), ~960 (technical), ~994 (role_str), ~1023 (date)
- `2026-07-15/WAVE_1/01_Brex.md`: prior full-package reference (Brex was previous target before Seaspan)
- `data/pipeline/PIPELINE.md`: reflects Brex at ✅ SUBMITTED, Seaspan at 🔵 SHOT (to be updated when resume is generated)
- `data/networking/CADENCE_FOOTER.md`: Brex T+0 cadence live, Seaspan awaiting HM name

## Key Execution Lessons & Strategy
- **Content branch completeness is non-negotiable.** The `_COMPANIES_WITH_CONTENT` gate + line-count validation in `gen_docx.py` prevents thin output. Always add branches for actively SHOT companies.
- **1-page conciseness pattern:** merged BUILT FROM ZERO into summary line, 5-6 bullets max, condensed education to single line — carry forward to new companies.
- **Generic else-branch trap:** The fallback generates generic bullets unrelated to target role. Never rely on it for active SHOOTs.
- **Company-specific keyword weave:** Seaspan needed ADKAR/Kotter/PROSCI language + change governance framework vocabulary — entirely different from Brex's "built from zero / AI-driven" keywords.
